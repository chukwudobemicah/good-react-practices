## REACT GOOD PRACTICES.

# lesson:

<p>when calling an event function, it should be like this 'onClick={onItemClick(item)}', not like this 'onClick={() => onItemClick(item)}'</p>

<!-- <p>For bad practice: The function </p>
<p>For good practice:  at the execution of the function the row height will become the value of ROW_HEIGHT, but this time the function handles everything, this makes things easier to read.</p> -->
